In this exercise, I implemented three types of sequence classifiers: log-linear, one-layer perceptron, and multi-layer perceptron, accommodating any number of layers and dimensions. The implementations are fully manual and include the backpropagation process.

1. train_loglin.py: main code for running the log-linear classifier.

2. train_mlp1.py: main code for running the one-layer perceptron classifier.

3. train_mlpn.py: main code for running the multi-layer perceptron classifier.
