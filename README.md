This repository contains my solutions to the exercises for the 'Deep Learning for Text and Sequences' course by Prof. Yoav Goldberg at Bar-Ilan University.

The repository contains a folder for each exercise:

1. EX1 - Fully manual implementation of log-linear, one-layer perceptron, and multilayer perceptron for sentence classification.

2. EX2 - Two-layer perceptron-based POS/NER tagger implemented with PyTorch. 

3. EX3 - BiLSTM-based POS/NER tagger implemented with PyTorch.
